        for all travelers. Few landmarks inspire such a passion for travel as this single iron structure.
        <br>Young travelers heading out on the road for the first time, couples looking for a special getaway, artists
        looking to spur their creativity, and romantics of all types are all drawn to Paris. This is a city where
        history and culture collide and where travelers of all kinds can find the experience they're after.
        <br>Head up the tower for spectacular views over the city, and don't miss a chance to see the tower lit up at

      <p style="font-size: large;"> The Colosseum<br>
        The most famous and largest structure still standing from the Roman Empire, the Colosseum is also the biggest
        attraction of modern-day Rome. It's been a bucket-list destination of travelers for generations. And it does not
        disappoint.
        Set in the heart of the city, the Colosseum is an easy place to visit. Direct flights from around the world land
        in Rome daily, making it a destination you can visit in a weekend if you choose.
        <br>Wander through Rome's ancient streets, tour the colosseum.

      <p style="font-size: large;"> Statue of Liberty<br>
        America is full of great sights and places to visit, but it's the Statue of Liberty that represents the United
        States like no other place. This symbol of freedom in New York City was gifted by the French to the American
        people in 1896.
        Of all the attractions in New York City, this is one every tourist must see.<br> The best thing to do at the
        Statue of Liberty is to take a ride up to her crown and soak up the view over the city. Access to the statue is
        via ferry, also a highlight of a visit.
        If you don't have time for a tour, you can still see the statue without leaving Manhattan. Head to Battery Park
        for the best views. You can also see the Statue of Liberty on a free ride on the Staten Island Ferry. See our
        guide to touring New York City by water on the NYC Ferry System.

      <p style="font-size: large;"> Machu Picchu, Peru<br>
        If you are planning to see only one attraction in South America, this is the place to come. The ancient Inca
        city of Machu Picchu is arguably the most impressive ruined city in the world.
        Much of the attraction comes from its location, high in the jungle-clad mountains of Peru.<br> Set on a high
        plateau with soaring green mountains, the setting is surreal. The sheer tenacity of the original builders to
        create this amazing place in what would have been impenetrable jungle, is, in itself, impressive.
        Visitor numbers are now limited to a maximum per day, so the experience has been greatly enhanced.

        height="500">
      <p style="font-size: large;"> The Acropolis in Athen<br>
        Perched above present day Athens, the Acropolis draws you up and in. Follow in the footsteps of the ancients as
        you walk up the same steps that have been walked on since 438 BC - 2,500 years.
        Views out over the city are incredible as you walk between the meticulously restored ancient buildings.<br> Near
        the end of the day, you'll want to linger and watch the sunset from the stairs near the entrance. This is a
        nightly ritual in Athens.
        The site is also impressive looking up at it from the city below. Spend an evening dining on a rooftop patio to
        soak in the view of the hilltop ruins lit up at night.

      <p style="font-size: large;">Pyramids of Giza<br>
        If you've visited places like the Colosseum in Rome or the Acropolis in Athens, built over 2,000 years ago, you
        may think you have a good handle on ancient sites. But the Pyramids of Giza take ancient to a whole other level.
        These were built over 4,500 years ago. Tourists were coming to see these magnificent structures literally
        thousands of years ago.
        Located just outside Cairo, the pyramids, which is also where you'll find the Sphinx, are easy to get to, and
        tours are easy to arrange.
        <br> A sunset camel ride around the structures is a wonderful experience.

      <p style="font-size: large;">. Great Wall of China <br>
        In a land of modern cities and towering skyscrapers, the Great Wall of China, built between the 14th and 17th
        centuries, is a stark contrast but a striking image that all visitors to China should see.
        A stroll along the top of the wall provides an incredible view of the structure snaking off into the distance.
        <br> The wall stretches an astounding 21,196 kilometers, through some remote areas.
        Many travelers seeing the sights of China choose to visit the wall on easily organized tours from Beijing, a
        relatively short motor coach ride away

      <p style="font-size: large;">Prague Castle, Czech Republic<br>
        Prague is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Sitting atop a hill across the river from
        the center of the city, Prague Castle casts an imposing aura over its surroundings. The castle is an incredible
        collection of buildings constructed from the 9th to 14th centuries.
        <br> Stroll over the ornate 14th-century Charles Bridge spanning the Vltava River and head up the hill to wander
        the narrow, twisty streets in the castle complex. The castle is one of the largest in the world, and around
        almost every corner is a historical building, church, or open square.
